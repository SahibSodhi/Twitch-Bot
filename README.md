Twitch is the largest video streaming service for gamers, with 15 million users active on the site daily and 3 million broadcasters month on month.  A subsidiary of Amazon, Twitch has grown further in popularity during the pandemic and expanded its repertoire to several other avenues, including online classrooms.
